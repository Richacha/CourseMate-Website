# team14 phase1.txt

After our first meeting with TA, we have agreed to remove some unnecessary features from our proposal. I also double checked
with Professor Mark that we are allowed to revise the proposal during phase 1.
As the result, the following information may differ a little from our proposal. Please regard phase1.txt as the standard our 
group is following. Thank you.

Please use the username and password we provided below to test our front end part.

User Instruction:

This is the username and password you should use:
================================================
User log in:
username:123
password:123  (For phase1, there is no need to apply hash function)


index(homePage):
This is the first page the user will see when entering our websites. On top of our homePage, are the entries for several other
pages of our website. The user can click on Forum on top of the page, or click "Enter the forum" orange button to enter forum.
The user can click on "About Us" to obtain more information about this website. The user can click on "Contact Us" to obtain
information about the team member, and how they can contact each of us. User can click on "Sign up" to sign up for an account,
or "Log in" to log into the website.

forumNotLoggedIn(the forum page display without log in):
User can freely browse forum without logging in. By doing so, the user is restricted from posting content and replying post.
The "New Post" button will automatically take user to the Log In page, and the "Reply" button will also automatically take the
user to the Log In page as well. User can click on the Posts to see the contents of the post, including its title, content,
and replies. User can use the search bar below "New Post" button to search for posts.

forum(the forum page display with user logged in):
User can now post new posts, and reply in the posts of other users. Besides these two functions, the function of the forum is
the same as alternate version of the forum(The forum page not logged in). Nevigation bar is also changed. User will have 
access to profile page, friends list page and study group list page. Users are not allowed to post with an empty title. 
The empty posts hard-coded in html is to demonstrate the scrolling effect.

profile:
A logged in user can click the profile button on top of the navigation bar to enter his profile page. The page will display
his personal info, including his courses, honour, hobbies. The user can update his information by clicking the
"Update Information" button at the very end of the page, and by doing so, they can freely edit the fields described above,
and click confirm to save the changes. You can also click on your study group list to go to the study groups that you are in.

        Something you will notice: You are allowed to update the profile picture by clicking the "browse" button and then
                                   "Update Information" button. However, the new profile picture should be stored in the 
                                   same directory called "profile".

studyGroup:
By clicking the studyGroup on top of the page in the navigation bar after log in, you will be taken to a page that contains
all the existing study groups. You can search for the studyGroups by course code, or name. You can also create your own group
by using the input to type in the name, and the course number of the group. After clicking on the group name, the user will be
navigated to the groupPage. We have provided a hard-coded example called "Happy 309 friends"

        Something you will notice: The searching in studyGroup is case-sensitive unlike the one in forum page. Searching for a
                                   study group requires more accuracy.
                                   To display all content in the table, empty the text field and click "Search" button again.
                                    

groupPage:
You can enter the groupPage by clicking on the groups displayed in the study group list inside your profile page. We
implemented one groupPage. In the studyGroup page, you can click on the names of the members to go to userInfoDisplay page,
and click on Announcement to display the announcements broadcasted by each group member. 

        Something you will notice: In phase 1, we redirect the profile pages for all members to the same profile page.
                                   This is not a bug. This design is purely for demo purpose since accessing different
                                   profile pages based on users will require server calls.
                                   
You can add new Announcement to the list by clicking "+new". By clicking "Group Chat" on the left, we can enter chat interface 
of the group, and you can send information using send button. You can join the group by clicking the "Join Group" button. 
Similarly, you can leave the group by clicking the "Leave Group" button on the left.

userInfoDisplay:
The info of other users will be displayed after clicking the name of the user on the left of groupPage. The page is similar to
the profile page, without the button to "update information".

friendList:
The friendList page can be accessed by clicking "Friends" button on top of the navigation bar for a logged in user. In the
page, you can chat with users by clicking their names on the left, and display your chat messages with each user in the
middle. You can search other users (if currently not friends) by typing in their full name(firstname + space + lastname, the 
name is case-sensitive), and add them as your friend (click the green "+ Add" buttons). You can also delete your friends
by click the red " - " buttons in the friend list on the left.
        The list of hard-coded users (if currently not friends) you can use to test the "adding friends" function:    
        {id: "0", firstName: "Haolin", lastName: "Zhang", profileImage: "0.jpg"},
        {id: "1", firstName: "a", lastName: "Zhang", profileImage: "1.jpg"},
        {id: "2", firstName: "b", lastName: "Zhang", profileImage: "2.jpg"},
        {id: "3", firstName: "c", lastName: "Zhang", profileImage: "3.jpg"},
        {id: "4", firstName: "d", lastName: "Zhang", profileImage: "4.jpeg"},
        {id: "5", firstName: "e", lastName: "Zhang", profileImage: "5.jpeg"},
        {id: "6", firstName: "f", lastName: "Zhang", profileImage: "6.jpeg"},
        {id: "7", firstName: "g", lastName: "Zhang", profileImage: "7.jpeg"},
        {id: "8", firstName: "g", lastName: "Zhang", profileImage: "8.jpeg"},
        {id: "9", firstName: "h", lastName: "Zhang", profileImage: "9.jpeg"},
        {id: "10", firstName: "h", lastName: "Zhang", profileImage: "10.jpeg"},
        {id: "11", firstName: "i", lastName: "Zhang", profileImage: "11.jpeg"},
        {id: "12", firstName: "j", lastName: "Zhang", profileImage: "12.jpeg"},
        {id: "13", firstName: "k", lastName: "Zhang", profileImage: "13.jpeg"},
        {id: "14", firstName: "k", lastName: "Zhang", profileImage: "14.jpeg"},
        {id: "15", firstName: "Haolin", lastName: "Zhang", profileImage: "15.jpg"},
        {id: "16", firstName: "a", lastName: "Zhang", profileImage: "16.jpg"}
        
        An interesting case to try: Search "k Zhang" (lower case k, upper case Z)
        There are two users with the same name, see what will happen :)

Administrator Instruction:


This is the username and password you should use:
================================================
User log in:
Username:admin
password:admin


admin:
After log in as Admin, you are taken to the admin page, which can keep track of all the users, groups, and posts. You can 
search or remove the groups, posts, and users. As the Admin, the user cannot have the same function as the normal users, and 
therefore cannot access forum and profile page. The admin can only log off the website.

        Something you will notice: The searching in admin page is case-sensitive unlike the one in forum page in order to 
                                   increase accuracy.
                                   To display all content in the table, empty the text field and click "Search" button again.
